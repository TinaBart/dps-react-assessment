SATURDAY
    4 hours to get postgresql working and able to read the api key
        (rails wouldn't read the .env file, so hardcoded key)
    Obscenity count to date: 1

    1 hour battling my own psyche. When is this due? Taylor said he didn't know maybe mid to end of next week. Dave implied over the weekend.

    30 minutes wanted to keep the DB local so I can work on this at work (I don't have wifi) - gave up, I'll do the external api call, maybe go to a coffee shop- unlikely to have time on Monday, maybe Tuesday. It would be delicious, staying positive.

SUNDAY
    TMI: Somehow everyone is sick, dogs and people. I won't iterate the details.

    3 hours working on Beers component. Probably 1 hour working. 2 hours, yes two, wondering why nothing was rendering, went back through the modules, stackflow, sure I did it right. Got angry enough to call the suicide hotline but dropped my phone, it landed on command+a and I realized I had black text on a black background! You did that on purpose. No, I am not proud of myself.

    Obscenity count to date: upward of 50.

    Note: YOU ARE A SADIST!!!

    Another note: Took a mental break and now my internet is out. FML.

MONDAY
    No time to sneak away from work.
    In class: oh, this is due tonight?
    30 minutes changing colors so it can be read on the background.

Total Time Tally: 9
